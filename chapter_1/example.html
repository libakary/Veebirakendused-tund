            This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is 
            a long one it might be split into several sub-headings.

        <h2>
            This is the sub-heading.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written.
            There may be even sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).
